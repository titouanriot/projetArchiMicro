You MUST have a Docker version installed on your machine.
At the root of the project (same location as the docker-compose.yml file), you must create a file called `.env` in which you have to put the different information inside : 

MYSQL_HOST=[host] 

MYSQL_USER=[user]

The app can be accessed at your `http://localhost:8080`.
